# Sim_THM_Multi_Res-Sc
Repository for Comsol Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical simulation of multi-DFMs (Discrete Fracture Models) reservoirs and Multi-Well production Scenarios

BatL_20190503_Stage_SF_Batch.mph
  is the model, to be loaded with using: COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4
  
 All other (.dxf) files correspond to the Discrete Fracture Networks, 
 5 differents names, with for each 7 differents fracture sets (fset1 to fste7);
  - Geometry 1 == LIMESTONE 
  - Geometry 2 == MARBLE
  - Geometry 3 == SKARN
  - Geometry 5 == lnstn_crop (a small patch taken from LIMSTONE to run trials)
  - Geometry 6 == set1, set2 (a hand made fracture model, with 2 fracture sets, again for trials)
